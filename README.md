# MySecretNotes
## Sql-injectable flask site
This flask site is a webservice mimmicking a secure note taking software site. You can register a user and write 
notes, your notes are "hidden" and can only be seen by you. You can share your notes and import other users notes 
from the public note id. This site is all fine and dandy on the surface, but it is heavily sql injectable. See 
if you can find all the injection points. I can promise you that you are able to: 
* bypass login 
* Steal other users passwords 
* Steal other users notes 
* Write notes on behalf of other users 
* and much more...
